# Energy-Production-Optimization
Solving a unit commitment problem.

This paper tackles the Unit Commitment Problem (UCP), which aims to min-
imize energy production costs while meeting hourly demand. We compare two
integer linear programming formulations that handle minimum uptime and down-
time: one using only status variables Takriti et al. (2000) and another using ad-
ditional start-up/shut-down variables Rajan and Takriti (2005). We then expand
the model to include non-controllable renewable sources. Our findings show that
the first formulation yields lower computational times, making it the most efficient
alternative.
